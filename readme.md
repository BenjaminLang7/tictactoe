This is a browser Tic-Tac-Toe AI game made with Python for the backend. 
+ The player will always be 'X' and the AI 'O'. 
+ Player always goes first. 
+ The AI does not play perfectly, and is defeatable. 

There is at least one bug, which is that the game does not have flawless validation logic and does not permit the very final move being in position 8.
